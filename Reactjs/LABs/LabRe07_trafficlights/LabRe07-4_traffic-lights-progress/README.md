- Axios - simple mockapi.io data.

- Graphics - shows how many pixels cross until the function is completed.

- Domains - It will remain to implement the domains with react-router.

> The intention of this project is to couple the `graphs` project to the `axios` project and continue with `domains`: "simulation & mySimulations(telemetry)" by two domains.
