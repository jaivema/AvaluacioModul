## WebSockets

WebSockets is a communication protocol that enables real-time, bidirectional communication between a client (usually a web browser) and a server. It provides a persistent connection that allows for efficient data exchange without the need for repeated HTTP requests.

WebSockets are particularly useful for applications that require instant updates, such as real-time chat applications, collaborative editing tools, and live data streaming.

In React, you can leverage the power of WebSockets by using libraries like Socket.IO or the native WebSocket API. These libraries enable you to establish a WebSocket connection, send and receive messages, and handle events for seamless real-time communication in your React applications.
